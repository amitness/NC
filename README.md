Chrome extension that automatically localizes prices on webpages to Nepalese Currency.

## Idea
The idea is to implement a simple browser extension that:

- Fetches latest currency exchange rate in the morning and caches it
- Converts all prices on webpages in foreign currency to equivalent NC.

For example, when you visit Amazon.com, you'll get all prices in $X replaced with Rs. XXX.
